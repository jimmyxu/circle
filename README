Logi Circle only allows 24 hours of footage on their free tier. I don't
want to pay subscription and thus made this to periodically pull videos
from their cloud onto my cloud.

It uses ffmpeg to bake timestamps into video file, and aws glacier for
long-term storage.

I have these in my crontab:

    30 */6 * * * src/circle/download.py >/dev/null 2>&1
    30 3   * * * src/circle/truncate.sh >/dev/null 2>&1
